# Correlative Information Maximization: A Biologically Plausible Approach to Supervised Deep Neural Networks without Weight Symmetry

This repo contains the codes to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper "Correlative Information Maximization: A Biologically Plausible Approach to Supervised Deep Neural Networks without Weight Symmetry". 

TLDR: We propose correlative information maximization as a normative supervised learning principle that allows derivation of biologically-plausible networks of pyramidal neurons and resolves the weight symmetry problem. 

All the codes are written in Python 3.8 and utilizes Pytorch tensors to be able to run the codes in GPU.

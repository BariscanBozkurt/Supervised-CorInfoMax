# Correlative Information Maximization: A Biologically Plausible Approach to Supervised Deep Neural Networks without Weight Symmetry

This repo contains the codes to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper "Correlative Information Maximization: A Biologically Plausible Approach to Supervised Deep Neural Networks without Weight Symmetry". TLDR: We propose correlative information maximization as a normative supervised learning principle that allows derivation of biologically-plausible networks of pyramidal neurons and resolves the weight symmetry problem. 

All the codes are written in Python 3 and utilizes Pytorch tensors to be able to run the codes in GPU.
